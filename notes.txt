use 'php artisan app:name = name' to change the name of the namespace
		
use this to generate html links inside laravel blade {!!Html::link('link','name')!!}

use 'composer require components/font-awesome' to add font awesome to your project
	and then add a reference to it in your app.scss file:
		@import "vendor/components/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome.scss";
		
		
NOTE: Import the "Kongregate WEBGL Utilities":

	Route::group(['middleware' => 'admin'], function(){
	Route::get('controlpanel', 'AdministrationController@ControlPanel');
});
	
	
DEALING WITH THE POST TOO LARGE EXCEPTION:
Here is what I did;
1- insert 'phpinfo()' to determine the path of the php.ini used by laravel
2- go to the location and if php.ini doesn't exist, create it as a copy of
   the 'php.ini.default' usind the sudo & cp commands.
3- now open the php.ini in vi(using sudo since its readonly) and edit the ff;
	-post_file_size = xXM
	-upload_file_max = xXM
	make sure the former is larger than the later
4- now restart apache and voila, you are good to go
